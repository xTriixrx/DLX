# DLX

<p align="center">
DLX is an efficient recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first search, backtracking algorithm that uses a technique to hide and unhide nodes from a circular doubly linked list in order to find all solutions to some exact cover problem. Many problems can be structured as a complete cover problem such as sudoku puzzles, tiling problems, and even simple scheduling problems. This algorithm was popularlized by Donald Knuth through his "The Art of Computer Programming" series, however gives credit to the algorithm to Hiroshi Hitotsumatsu and K≈çhei Noshita with having invented the idea in 1979.

This specific implementation implements the sparse matrix approach and the latest revision of the algorithm, where only 1's are stored in the matrix and the need for linking non header nodes left to right are not necessary. This implementation deploys the use of "spacer nodes" which essentially is a way to determine the current row as well as changing between rows while the searching "dance" is taking place.
